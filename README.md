# GenericCryptanalyzer
A generic library used for linear and differential cryptanalysis written in C++.

## About
GenericCryptanalyzer is a Bachelor's Thesis project that implements an automated discovery 
of differential & linear characteristics of a cryptographic block cipher using a branch-and-bound
algorithm inspired by Matsuiâ€™s Search Algorithm For The Best Differential/Linear Trails.
