# GenericCryptanalyzer
A generic library used for differential cryptanalysis of block ciphers written in C++.

## About
GenericCryptanalyzer is my Bachelor's Thesis project that implements a automated discovery search algorithm of differential characteristics of a block cipher. It uses a branch-and-bound algorithm inspired by Matsuiâ€™s Search Algorithm For The Best Differential/Linear Trails, presented in [1].

### Motivation
Differential cryptanalysis was introduced in [5] and Linear cryptanalysis was first introduced in [7]. Over the years theese techniques have proven to be one of the most efficient techniques in searching vulnerabilities in block ciphers.

A good tutorial on both differential and linear cryptanalysis can be found in [6].

As computational power and interest in safe cryptographic protocols has increased over time, automated search for differential and linear characteristics has become a must for both cryptologists and cryptanalysts. This tool aims to help in automated discovery of such vulnerabilities in order to save research time.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
In order to install GenericCryptanalyzer you will need to have installed the following C++ libraries:
* boost

## Examples
Some examples of how to interract with the library can be found in `examples/`.

## Documentation
The documentation for this project can be found [here](https://gabitulba.github.io/GenericCryptanalyzer/).

## Further Improvements
* Finish adding docs for `src/builders/`
* Add more unit tests
* Implement optimisations presented in [2], [3], [4] to improve performance
* Add more types of boxes to support more ciphers
* Add support for linear cryptanalysis
